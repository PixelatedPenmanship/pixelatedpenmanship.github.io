# 🖋️ **Corporate Escape Hatch: One Engineer’s Fountain Pen Rebellion** 🔧💥  

Hey 👋 – I’m **Aravind**, professional **spreadsheet ninja** by day, **accidental pen connoisseur** by night, and your resident **anti-corporate ink warrior**. This blog is my glorious middle finger to the soul-crushing grind – equal parts **tech deep dives**, **fountain pen obsession**, and **documented attempts at adulting** (spoiler: the coffee gets spilled, the code gets debugged).  

### 🌟 Why You’re Here (Besides Tech Peeves & Pen Porn):  
✅ **Tech Rants** – Because even my smart watch judges my life choices  
✅ **Fountain Pen Fandom** – Yes, I own countless nibs and one *very* judgmental ink collection 🔴🟢🔵  
✅ **Existential Crises via Handwriting** – Is it therapy? Or just terrible penmanship?
